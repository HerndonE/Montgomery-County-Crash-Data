# Montgomery County Crash Data

# Introduction
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administraion, the latest data on vehicle miles traveled shows that motorcyclists are about 28 times as likely as passenger car occupants to die in a motor vehicle traffic crash. Safe motorcycling takes balance, coordination, and good judgment. Our goal in this project is to explore information in the data set in relation to motorcycles and see if we can confirm these statistics.
